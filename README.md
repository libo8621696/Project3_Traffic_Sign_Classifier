Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

In this project, I have included an Ipython notebook with complete code. Be sure to download the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/libo8621696/Project3_Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). The html format of the output [html](https://github.com/libo8621696/Project3_Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) is applied here  

The detailed writeup of the project. Check out the [writeup](https://github.com/libo8621696/Project3_Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/writeup_project3_traffic_sign_classifier.md) in a markdown file. The pdf document is also applied, please refer to [pdf](https://github.com/libo8621696/Project3_Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/writeup_project3_traffic_sign_classifier.pdf).

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file 


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
